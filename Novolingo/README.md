### Description
Our team intercepted messages between two military bases, but it seems that they are in a language that doesn't exist. Talk about security!
We don't know the exact content of the messages, but we have linked them with the most important events that took place in that respective time frame.
We need you to use these messages to learn this new language. There is a new message that needs to be decrypted. Make haste!

1. What happened to our troup nr.43? (1 word, past simple)
2. Where can we expect an attack? (1 word, direction)
3. Who is retreating? (1 word, expressed as in the translations)
