We have a website with the same photo repeated many times. If we inspect the HTML code, we can see that the image element sometimes begins with the source, other times with the width of the image. 

Since this is a Steganography challenge, and given the description, a possible message hidden in this `HTML` file could be given by the image tags. Those that start the usual way, with `<img src`, represent 1, and those that start with with `<img width` represent 0. 

We can do the replacements by copy-pasting and changing manually, or we can use the `solve.py` script in this directory to create the binary string resulting from the two options. Then, we can either use `CyberChef` or the `binary_to_ascii.py` script to decode the binary string and we get the actual flag.
