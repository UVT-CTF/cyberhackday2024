### Description

Our field agents intercepted a message over a secret line of communications of the criminal organization we've been chasing.

Although written in another alphabet, the words don't seem to belong to any language, so it must be encrypted somehow. It is said that their mastermind is proficient in linguistics and cryptology alike, so perhaps he might be the very author of the message...

Help us decrypt the secret communication and unveil this epic conspiracy!
