# Crushing on the Spectrum: All Star Edition
> author: Alin, Anca, category: steganography
### Description
There's this girl I like, even though she looks kind of dumb when she keeps putting her finger and thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead. She also keeps sending me corrupted audio files, but I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. Can you help me fix it and figure out if she's trying to tell me something?
