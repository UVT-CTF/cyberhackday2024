# Banca Bitcoiniano-Românească
> author: FeDEX, category: misc

### Description
People often claim that cryptocurrency is basically gambling, but that can't be true, right? Cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, is simply digital money. To help debunk this myth and to prove that traditional finance can live in harmony with decentralized finance, we need you to analyze a custom Liquidity Pool implementation that utilizes both the Romanian RON and Bitcoin. Your task is to demonstrate that it's impossible to double your money in this setup, as gamblers might try to do. Please prove that crypto isn't gambling!
